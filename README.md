# breakthrough-pairin-survey-sorter-extension


A basic Chrome Extension.
When loaded, enabled, and pinned to the toolbar:
  - If you are viewing the PAIRIN Survey webpage:
    - you can click on the Breakthrough logo and sort the list by the Adjective ID (mostly alphabetically sorted).

Requires installation to Chrome through the Chrome Extension Manager
- Load Unpacked
- Pin to ToolBar
- Options: Enable in Incognito Mode
- FOR SOME REASON: You have to use it in a regular (non-incognito mode) tab to initialize it first
  - I used an .html file of the survey that I "Save As"ed.
- Once it has been initialized in the regular browser, you can use it in incognito mode to enter surveys.
